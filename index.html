                    <p>Family Room enables users to interact with posts, create new posts, and share media through its linear group chat. Each post is its own contained conversation, so only those who interact with the post will be notified upon further comments. The days of countless irrelevant notifications are over!</p>

                     <p>“Want to see adorable photos of my nephew?” says every aunt and uncle, ever. Family Room’s media feature allows users to specify exactly which type of media they want to see from the group’s collective album as well as who sent it. No more sifting through the group’s media history just to find that one baby photo! </p>
